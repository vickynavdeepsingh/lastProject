Sure! Here's a detailed project idea for building a web application using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL:

### Project Idea: Online Bookstore

#### Project Overview
Create a full-fledged online bookstore where users can browse, search, and purchase books. The application will allow users to create accounts, manage their profiles, add books to their shopping cart, and complete purchases. Admins will have additional capabilities to manage the inventory of books, including adding new books, editing existing book details, and removing books from the store.

#### Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and routing.
- **MySQL**: Relational database to store book, user, and order data.
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware for Node.js to handle user login and registration.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering views.
- **Nodemailer**: For sending order confirmation emails to users.
